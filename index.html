            BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
        <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum <br>blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to <br>members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. <br> Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

        <h3>(BONDING CURVES ARE A PONZI)</h3>
        <p>There are no bonding curves here. Buying a Bored Ape costs 0.08 ETH. There <br> are no price tiers; BAYC membership costs the same for everyone.</p>
        <p class="yaya">Note: Thirty apes are being withheld from the sale. <br> These will be used for giveaways, puzzle rewards—and <br> for the creators' BAYC memberships</p>

        <h1>BUY An APE</h1>

        <h1>THE SPECS</h1>
        <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 <br> possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes <br> are dope, but some are rarer than others.</p>

        <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br> hosted on IPFS. <a href="">(See Record and Proof.)</a> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.</p>

        <p>To access members-only areas such as <a href=""> THE BATHROOM </a> , Apeholders will <br> need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>

            <h1>WELCOME TO THE CLUB</h1>
            <p>When you buy a Bored Ape, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership <br> access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity, and <br> open digital doors for you.</p>

        <h1>THE BATHROOM</h1>
        <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It <br> contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like <br> any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write <br> expletives.</p>
        <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen <br> minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A <br> members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.</p>
        <p>We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
